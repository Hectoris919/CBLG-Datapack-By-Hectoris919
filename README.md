# CBLG Datapack by Hectoris919

This datapack adds fast, compact logic gates to Minecraft 1.16+ in the form of command blocks.

When I say these things are fast, I mean that they work almost instentaniously ( They run as fast as your game can run, making them literally the quickest logic gates in Minecraft ).

Here's a link to a video I put together to showcasing how to use these Command Block Logic Gates ( Otherwise known as CBLGs ):

# FAQs:

***"The file I downloaded doesn't work! Help!"***

>...? I might be able to help you out if you were a little more specific

 ***"I put the file into the datapacks folder of my minecraft world but it wasn't detected when I used the /reload command."***

>Ah, ok. Thank you for being more specific.
>
>This is an easy mistake to make. You may notice that clicking the "Clone or Download" button downloads a file called "CBLG-Datapack-by-Hectoris919.zip" ( note the dashes between the words )
>
>Unfortunatly, because GitHub places the files in a folder in the .zip files you download, just placing the zip file you get by clicking the "Clone or Download" into your world's datapack folder will not cause it to be recognized by Minecraft. There are two methods for fixing this:
>
>***Method 1:***
>
>Click on the "CBLG Datapack by Hectoris919.zip" file in this repository and then click the download button to the right of the file. Notice that the file you just downloaded is named "CBLG Datapack by Hectoris919.zip" not "CBLG-Datapack-by-Hectoris919.zip". This file should be recognized by minecraft and you should be able to use this datapack in your world.
>
>***Method 2:***
>
>Take the file downloaded from clicking the "Clone or Download" button and extract it. You should see a folder named "CBLG-Datapack-by-Hectoris919-master." Inside this folder is both this README.md file and the CBLG Datapack by Hectoris919.zip file. Copy the .zip into your world's datapack folder and reload your world. You should now be able to use this datapack

It makes me think you are shouting at me and makes me consider not looking at your post )**. Also, I would appreciate it if you would be detailed in your description of said bug or suggestion.
