# CBLG Datapack by Hectoris919


Troubleshooting:
----------------

"The file I downloaded does not work. I put it into the datapacks folder of my world but it wasn't detected when I reloaded my datapacks"

Because of the way GitHub zips up files for download, just placing the zip file you get by clicking the Clone or Download into your world's datapack folder will not cause it to be recognized by Minecraft.


Click on the "CBLG Datapack by Hectoris919.zip" file in this repository and then click the download button to the right of the file to download a working version.
