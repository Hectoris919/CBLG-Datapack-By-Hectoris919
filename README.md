***"The file I downloaded doesn't work! Help!"***

...? I might be able to help you out if you were a little more specific

 ***"Ok, Ok. I put the file into the datapacks folder of my minecraft world but it wasn't detected when I used the /reload command."***

Ah, ok. Thank you for being more specific.

This is a common mistake that is easy to fix. You may notice that 

Because of the way GitHub zips up files for download, just placing the zip file you get by clicking the Clone or Download into your world's datapack folder will not cause it to be recognized by Minecraft.

Click on the "CBLG Datapack by Hectoris919.zip" file in this repository and then click the download button to the right of the file to download a version you can just drop into. Notice that the downloaded file is named "CBLG Datapack by Hectoris919.zip," not "CBLG-Datapack-by-Hectoris919.zip"
